This is where you can download WasteLanders, Official WasteLanders Expansion Packs and Maps, And User Created Expansion Packs and Maps. If you want to submit your expansion pack or map to be added to this Github Repository then it must meet these requirements:

1. Expansion Packs or Maps must be submitted in a valid .mcaddon, .mcpack, or mcworld format.

2. Expansion Packs or Maps should not include unnecessary files from the base addon, this means unedited files that aren't needed for the expansion pack to function.

3. Expansion Packs or Maps should not use files from other addons or maps unless you have permission to do so with proof provided in the expansion pack or map itself, may be a screenshot or license file.

4. Expansion Packs or Worlds should not be encrpyted in any way and should function with minimal bugs, if an Expansion Pack is broken by a minecraft or even a wastelanders update then it should be fixed asap.

5. Abandoned Expansion Packs that are broken will either be deleted or fixed and absorbed into the base addon, this will be a case by case basics. I will be ensuring quality control to make sure that Expansion Packs and Maps are of high standard and stablity for players.
